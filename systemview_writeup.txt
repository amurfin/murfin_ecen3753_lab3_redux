"segger_overall_task_periodicity.png"
In this, you can see the slider task running every 100ms, and the buttn task running every 50ms.
The idle task is running the rest of the time.

"segger_capsense_btn_and_led.png"
In this, you can see a zoomed in case of the slider task.  You can see that the button task
attempts to run in the middle of the capsense task, but it is lower priority and is blocked.
We can see the LED task run immediately following the capsense task, and then again immediately 
following the button task.  After the second led update, the scheduler brings the cpu back into
the button task, to restart the delay timer (which is fine).

"segger_2nd_btn_and_led.png"
In this, you can see a zoomed in case of the 2nd iteration of the button task, and its LED update.
This is the execution that is aligned to run directly between instances of the slider task. 
I found that by changing the period of the button task to 50 ticks, I was able to solve the 
flickering LED issue.
